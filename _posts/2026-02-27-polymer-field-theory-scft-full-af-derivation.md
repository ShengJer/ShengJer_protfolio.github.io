## Summary

This note presents a canonical-ensemble self-consistent field theory (SCFT) derivation for a linear incompressible AB diblock copolymer melt using a full auxiliary-field formulation.

The derivation follows the field-theoretic route from a microscopic polymer model to the effective Hamiltonian in terms of collective and conjugate fields.

At the saddle-point level, the SCFT equations are obtained in the standard propagator-based framework together with incompressibility and self-consistency relations.
