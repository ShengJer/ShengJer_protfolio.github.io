## Summary

This note summarizes a canonical-ensemble self-consistent field theory (SCFT) derivation for an linear incompressible AB diblock copolymer melt.

The derivation starts from a microscopic polymer model with:
- Gaussian-chain model
- Flory-Huggins A-B contact interaction
- A incompressibility constraint

It then introduces collective density fields and auxiliary conjugate fields through functional delta identities and Fourier representations. This converts the many-chain partition function into a field-theoretic form and defines an effective Hamiltonian.

At the mean-field saddle point, the SCFT equations are obtained, including:
- Forward/backward chain propagator equations
- Segment-density expressions from propagators
- Incompressibility condition
- Self-consistent relations between fields and densities

Finally, the derivation is recast into the common real-field and volume-fraction form, and interpreted through the free-energy decomposition into:
- Interaction enthalpy
- Field-coupling/incompressibility contribution
- Conformational entropy contribution
