**Status:** Published

**Project Goal:**  
Build an end-to-end workflow for Cahn-Hilliard microstructure evolution, including MPI-based simulation, dimensionality reduction (PCA/autoencoder pipelines), and sequence prediction with an L-MAU model.

**My Role:**  
Developed and maintained the simulation and ML workflow, integrated data pipelines, and organized training/testing steps for reduced-order prediction.

**Tech Stack:**  
C, MPI, FFTW3, GSL, Python, NumPy, PCA, Autoencoder, L-MAU
